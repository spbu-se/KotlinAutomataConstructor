## Build system

To build this project, you must use JDK 11+.

This project uses Gradle build system. Here are commands for some of its most important tasks:

| Command (Windows)    | Description                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew assemble` | Builds without tests                     |
| `./gradlew run`      | Runs the application                     |
| `./gradlew test`     | Runs the unit tests                      |
| `./gradlew msi`      | Builds .msi installer for 64-bit Windows |
| `./gradlew tasks`    | Displays all runnable tasks              |

When running Gradle task you can specify target platform classifier with `-Pplatform={classifier}` option,
the following classifiers are supported: `win`, `linux`, `mac`, `win-x86`, `linux-aarch64`, `mac-aarch64`.
